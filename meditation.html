        <p>With the hectic pace and demands of modern life, many people feel stressed and over-worked. It often feels like there is just not enough time in the day to get everything done. Our stress and tiredness make us unhappy, impatient and frustrated. It can even affect our health. We are often so busy we feel there is no time to stop and meditate! But meditation actually gives you more time by making your mind calmer and more focused. A simple ten or fifteen minute breathing meditation as explained below can help you to overcome your stress and find some inner peace and balance.<br /><br />Meditation can also help us to understand our own mind. We can learn how to transform our mind from negative to positive, from disturbed to peaceful, from unhappy to happy. Overcoming negative minds and cultivating constructive thoughts is the purpose of the transforming meditations found in the Buddhist tradition. This is a profound spiritual practice you can enjoy throughout the day, not just while seated in meditation.</p>

    <!-- MEDITATION POSTURE -->

    <div class="heartbeat container">
        <div class="name">
    		<h1>Meditation Posture</h1>
            <i class="fa fa-heart fa-lg"></i>
        </div>
    	<p> When we practice meditation we need to have a comfortable seat and a good posture. The most important feature of the posture is to keep our back straight. To help us do this, if we are sitting on a cushion we make sure that the back of the cushion is slightly higher than the front, inclining our pelvis slightly forward. It is not necessary at first to sit cross-legged, but it is a good idea to become accustomed to sitting in the posture of Buddha Vairochana. If we cannot hold this posture we should sit in one which is as close to this as possible while remaining comfortable.<br /><br />The seven features of Vairochana&apos;s posture are: 
            <ol>
                <li>The legs are crossed in the vajra posture. This helps to reduce thoughts and feelings of desirous attachment.</li>
                <li>The right hand is placed in the left hand, palms upwards, with the tips of the thumbs slightly raised and gently touching. The hands are held about four fingers width below the navel. This helps us to develop good concentration. The right hand symbolizes method and the left hand symbolizes wisdom - the two together symbolize the union of method and wisdom. The two thumbs at the level of the navel symbolize the blazing of inner fire.</li>
                <li>The back is straight but not tense. This helps us to develop and maintain a clear mind, and it allows the subtle energy winds to flow freely.</li>
                <li>The lips and teeth are held as usual, but the tongue touches against the back of the upper teeth. This prevents excessive salivation while also preventing our mouth from becoming too dry.</li>
                <li>The head is tipped a little forward with the chin slightly tucked in so that the eyes are cast down. This helps prevent mental excitement.</li>
                <li>The eyes are neither wide open nor completely closed, but remain half open and gaze down along the line of the nose. If the eyes are wide open we are likely to develop mental excitement and if they are closed we are likely to develop mental sinking.</li>
                <li>The shoulders are level and the elbows are held slightly away from the sides to let air circulate.</li>
            </ol>

    <!-- BREATHING MEDITATION -->

    <div class="heartbeat container">
        <div class="name">
             <h1>Breathing Meditation</h1>
            <i class="fa fa-heart fa-lg"></i>
        </div>
        <p>When we have settled down comfortably on our meditation seat we begin by becoming aware of the thoughts and distractions that are arising in our mind. Then we gently turn our attention to our breath, letting its rhythm remain normal. As we breathe out we imagine that we are breathing away all disturbing thoughts and distractions in the form of black smoke that vanishes in space. As we breathe in we imagine that we are breathing in all the blessings and inspiration of the holy beings in the form of white light that enters our body and absorbs into our heart. <br /><br />We maintain this visualization single-pointedly with each inhalation and exhalation for twenty-one rounds, or until our mind has become peaceful and alert. If we concentrate on our breathing in this way, negative thoughts and distractions will temporarily disappear because we cannot concentrate on more than one object at a time. <br /><br />At the conclusion of our breathing meditation we should think &quot;Now I have received the blessings and inspiration of all the holy beings&quot;. At this stage our mind is like a clean white cloth which we can now color with a virtuous motivation such as compassion or bodhichitta.</p><br />
